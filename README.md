# Linux_labs
These are the solutions I created for my labs in Linux.
The activity files are not included as they are school property. 
The file structure in the virtual machine I was provided will also not be explicitly included. However, I understand inferences will be made through the commands displayed.
I am including my commands and code for personal development only.
